Hybrid Ensemble Learning (ACLR) model for efficient botnet detection in
IoT systems. It combines ANN, CNN, RNN, and ML algorithms using a
stacking approach to capture complex traffic patterns. Trained on the
UNSW-NB15 dataset, the model achieved 96.98% accuracy with strong
ROC-AUC performance and provides real-time attack prediction through a
web-based interface.
